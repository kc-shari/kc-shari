- 👋 Hi, I’m @kc-shari
- 👀 I’m interested in DevOps and automation through IaC.
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my Terraform knowledge and supporting Azure DevOps projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborating with developers to further their DevOps processes, especially if they're using Atlassian tools.
- 📫 My email address is shari.anderson@gmail.com so feel free to contact me about DevOps.
